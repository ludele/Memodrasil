* What is this project?
** What is it meant to do?
This is a application that was meant to store information in JSON in different categories and subcategories. The application is meant to be a modern way of categorizing information in different categories for a decent structure. The application could be used simply as a diary or like a complex archive, it's up to the user.

* Current state of the project 
** Currently in it's first and only functional state.
The code that exists works. by going to the javascript dist folder and having node and the required libraries installed it should work.

Though this base is scraped. The project will use C# instead and change direction. Because I've noticed that javascript sucks.
